# Supabase Database Changes for Complete User Deletion

## Overview

This guide documents all the necessary Supabase database changes to support the complete user deletion functionality. These changes ensure that when users are deleted, all associated data and credentials are completely removed from the system.

## Database Schema Analysis

### Current Database Tables with User Relationships

1. **Core Tables**:
   - `user_profiles` - Main user profile table
   - `auth.users` - Supabase authentication table

2. **Associated Tables**:
   - `payments` - User payment records
   - `course_enrollments` - Course enrollment records
   - `testimonials` - User testimonials
   - `member_reviews` - Member review system
   - `referral_analytics` - Referral tracking
   - `notification_logs` - Notification history
   - `notification_templates` - Template management
   - `system_settings` - System configuration

## Required Migrations

### 1. ✅ Password Template Migration (Already Available)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250120000002_update_welcome_templates_with_password.sql`
- Updates welcome email and WhatsApp templates to include password placeholders
- **Status**: Ready to apply

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Foreign Key Constraints (Newly Created)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250120000003_enhance_user_deletion_foreign_keys.sql`
- Ensures all foreign key constraints have proper CASCADE DELETE behavior
- Creates utility functions for user deletion management
- **Status**: Ready to apply

## How to Apply the Migrations

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Apply Password Template Migration**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**
   - Copy the content from `supabase/migrations/20250120000002_update_welcome_templates_with_password.sql`
   - Paste and execute the SQL

2. **Apply Foreign Key Migration**:
   - In the same SQL Editor
   - Copy the content from `supabase/migrations/20250120000003_enhance_user_deletion_foreign_keys.sql`
   - Paste and execute the SQL

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI (if configured)
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migrations
supabase migration up
```

### Option 3: Manual SQL Execution
Copy and execute each migration file's content in your database.

## What Each Migration Does

### Migration 1: Password Template Updates
- Updates the "Welcome Email" template to include `{{temporary_password}}` placeholder
- Updates the "Welcome WhatsApp" template to include password with security instructions
- Adds security notices about changing passwords after first login

### Migration 2: Enhanced Foreign Key Constraints
- Updates foreign key constraints to use CASCADE DELETE for all user-related tables
- Creates three utility functions:
  - `cleanup_orphaned_auth_users()` - Cleans up auth users without profiles
  - `verify_user_deletion(user_id)` - Verifies complete user deletion
  - `get_user_deletion_stats()` - Provides deletion statistics

## Database Functions Created

### 1. `cleanup_orphaned_auth_users()`
**Purpose**: Cleans up auth users that don't have corresponding user_profiles
**Usage**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM cleanup_orphaned_auth_users();
```
**Returns**: `(deleted_count, remaining_count)`

### 2. `verify_user_deletion(user_id)`
**Purpose**: Verifies complete deletion of a user from all tables
**Usage**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM verify_user_deletion('user-uuid-here');
```
**Returns**: Table showing deletion status for each table

### 3. `get_user_deletion_stats()`
**Purpose**: Provides statistics about user deletion status
**Usage**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_user_deletion_stats();
```
**Returns**: `(total_users, orphaned_auth_users, users_with_associated_data)`

## Testing the Complete System

### Step 1: Apply Migrations
Apply both migrations to your Supabase database.

### Step 2: Test User Deletion
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → User Management
2. Select a test user to delete
3. Click Delete User
4. Verify the user disappears completely

### Step 3: Test User Creation
1. Try to create a new user with a previously deleted email
2. Verify no email conflicts occur
3. Check that welcome notifications include passwords

### Step 4: Verify Database Cleanup
1. Use the verification functions to ensure complete deletion:
```sql
-- Check for orphaned auth users
SELECT * FROM get_user_deletion_stats();

-- Verify specific user deletion
SELECT * FROM verify_user_deletion('user-uuid-here');
```

## Expected Results After Applying Migrations

### ✅ Complete User Deletion
- Users deleted from both `user_profiles` and `auth.users` tables
- All associated records automatically deleted via CASCADE DELETE
- Email addresses freed up for reuse

### ✅ Enhanced Security
- Welcome notifications include generated passwords
- Security instructions for password changes
- No orphaned authentication credentials

### ✅ Better Monitoring
- Utility functions to monitor deletion status
- Statistics for system health monitoring
- Verification tools for data integrity

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Foreign Key Constraint Errors
**Solution**: The migration handles constraint updates automatically. If errors occur:
1. Check if constraints already exist with CASCADE DELETE
2. Verify table names and column names match your schema

### Issue: Function Creation Errors
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you have admin privileges
2. Check if functions with same names already exist
3. Verify the `has_admin_role()` function exists

### Issue: Migration Order
**Solution**: Apply migrations in timestamp order:
1. `20250120000002_update_welcome_templates_with_password.sql`
2. `20250120000003_enhance_user_deletion_foreign_keys.sql`

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Complete user data removal ensures GDPR compliance
- No orphaned authentication credentials
- All associated records are properly cleaned up

### Access Control
- Utility functions are secured with `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Admin-only access to sensitive operations
- Proper RLS policies maintained

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Impact
- CASCADE DELETE operations are efficient
- Indexes ensure fast deletion operations
- Utility functions are optimized for performance

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Use `get_user_deletion_stats()` periodically
- Monitor for orphaned auth users
- Track user deletion success rates

## Next Steps After Applying Migrations

1. **Test the System**: Perform comprehensive testing of user deletion and creation
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use the utility functions to monitor system health
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure team members understand the new functionality
4. **Train Administrators**: Show admin users how to use the verification tools

## Support

For any issues with these migrations:
1. Check the migration execution logs for specific errors
2. Verify your Supabase project has the required permissions
3. Ensure all prerequisite tables exist in your database
4. Contact technical support if migration errors persist
