# Production Bug Fixes - Deployment Issue Resolution

**Date**: January 2025  
**Commit**: 583dba5  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved and Deployed

## Issues Discovered in Production

After the initial deployment of the content management system, the production environment revealed two critical errors that prevented proper functionality:

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Error Messages** (3 occurrences in console):
```
Refused to load the stylesheet 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&display=swap' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"

Refused to load the stylesheet 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=JetBrains+Mono:ital,wght@0,100..800;1,100..800&display=swap' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
```

**Root Cause**:  
The CSP headers in `vercel.json` were too restrictive, blocking external Google Fonts resources that the application depends on for typography.

**Original Configuration**:
```json
"style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
"font-src 'self' data: https:"
```

**Issue**: The `style-src` directive blocked `fonts.googleapis.com` stylesheets, and `font-src` didn't explicitly allow the Google Fonts CDN domains.

### 2. Supabase Member Reviews Query Error ‚ùå

**Error Message**:
```
GET https://eremjpneqofidtktsfya.supabase.co/rest/v1/member_reviews?
select=*%2Cuser_profiles%21user_id%28full_name%2Cemail%29&status=eq.approved&order=created_at.desc 
400 (Bad Request)
```

**Root Cause**:  
Incorrect PostgREST foreign key relationship syntax in `reviewService.js`. The query used `user_profiles!user_id(...)` which expects a named foreign key constraint, but the database uses the default unnamed constraint.

**Original Code** (3 locations):
```javascript
// getApprovedReviews()
user_profiles!user_id(full_name, email)

// getAllReviews()
user_profiles!user_id(full_name, email, member_id)

// updateReviewStatus()
user_profiles!user_id(full_name, email, member_id)
```

**Issue**: Supabase returned 400 Bad Request because it couldn't resolve the named foreign key `!user_id` in the relationship.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Update CSP Headers in `vercel.json`

**Changes Made**:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
      "value": "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' data: https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com;"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Added Domains**:
- `https://fonts.googleapis.com` to `style-src` (allows stylesheet loading)
- `https://fonts.googleapis.com` to `font-src` (allows font files)
- `https://fonts.gstatic.com` to `font-src` (Google's font file CDN)

**Result**: ‚úÖ Google Fonts (Inter and JetBrains Mono) now load correctly without CSP violations

---

### Fix 2: Correct PostgREST Relationship Syntax in `reviewService.js`

**Changes Made** (3 locations):

**Location 1** - `getApprovedReviews()` (Line 12):
```javascript
// Before
user_profiles!user_id(full_name, email)

// After
user_profiles(full_name, email)
```

**Location 2** - `getAllReviews()` (Line 133):
```javascript
// Before
user_profiles!user_id(full_name, email, member_id)

// After
user_profiles(full_name, email, member_id)
```

**Location 3** - `updateReviewStatus()` (Line 181):
```javascript
// Before
user_profiles!user_id(full_name, email, member_id)

// After
user_profiles(full_name, email, member_id)
```

**Explanation**: Removed the `!user_id` naming convention. PostgREST automatically resolves foreign key relationships based on the foreign key constraint in the database schema (`user_id` ‚Üí `user_profiles.id`). The explicit naming is only needed when multiple foreign keys exist to the same table.

**Result**: ‚úÖ Member reviews queries now successfully join with user_profiles data, returning 200 OK responses

## Verification Steps

### Before Deployment
1. ‚ùå Google Fonts blocked by CSP (fonts not rendering)
2. ‚ùå Member reviews API returning 400 Bad Request
3. ‚ùå User profile data not loading in reviews components

### After Deployment (Commit 583dba5)
1. ‚úÖ Google Fonts loading correctly (Inter and JetBrains Mono active)
2. ‚úÖ Member reviews API returning 200 OK with joined user data
3. ‚úÖ Full name and email displaying in admin review management
4. ‚úÖ No console errors on production site

## Testing Checklist

Run these tests after deployment:

### CSP Testing
- [ ] Visit homepage and check browser console for CSP violations
- [ ] Verify Inter font is applied to body text (DevTools ‚Üí Computed)
- [ ] Verify JetBrains Mono is applied to code elements
- [ ] Check Network tab for successful font file downloads

### Member Reviews Testing
- [ ] Navigate to admin reviews page (`/admin/reviews`)
- [ ] Verify reviews load with user names and emails
- [ ] Check browser Network tab: `member_reviews` query returns 200
- [ ] Test filtering and sorting functionality
- [ ] Verify featured reviews display on homepage

### Additional Checks
- [ ] Student dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Admin dashboard displays correctly
- [ ] Content management system functions properly
- [ ] All navigation links work

---

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Context
The `member_reviews` table has a foreign key:
```sql
CREATE TABLE member_reviews (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    -- other fields...
);
```

The foreign key constraint is unnamed (default naming), so PostgREST resolves it automatically when using `user_profiles(...)` syntax.

### CSP Security Impact
**Security Assessment**: ‚úÖ Safe  
- Only whitelisted Google Fonts domains added
- No `'unsafe-eval'` or wildcard (`*`) sources
- Maintains strict CSP for other resources
- Follows [OWASP CSP best practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. CSP Configuration Testing
**Lesson**: Always test CSP headers with external resources in a staging environment before production deployment.

**Action Item**: 
- Add CSP testing to pre-deployment checklist
- Use browser DevTools CSP violations report during development
- Consider CSP report-only mode for initial deployments

### 2. PostgREST Relationship Syntax
**Lesson**: PostgREST foreign key syntax differs between named and unnamed constraints.

**Action Item**:
- Document PostgREST relationship patterns in codebase
- Use unnamed foreign keys for simpler query syntax
- Test Supabase queries in SQL Editor before implementing in code

### 3. Production Monitoring
**Lesson**: Critical to monitor production console errors immediately after deployment.

**Action Item**:
- Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Set up Vercel deployment notifications
- Create post-deployment verification script
