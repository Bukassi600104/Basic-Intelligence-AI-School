---

## üìã DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Phase 1: Database Setup (DO THIS FIRST)

#### Step 1: Apply Member ID System Migration
1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251025100000_member_id_system.sql`
3. Run the migration
4. Verify success:
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   SELECT * FROM member_id_counter;
   
   -- Check if trigger is active
   SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger 
   WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_assign_member_id';
   
   -- Preview next member ID
   SELECT get_next_member_id_preview();
   ```

#### Step 2: Backfill Existing Users
1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251025100001_backfill_member_ids.sql`
3. Run the migration
4. **IMPORTANT**: Review the output in the SQL Editor
   - It will show all assigned member IDs
   - Admin users get ADMIN001, ADMIN002, etc.
   - Regular users get BI0001, BI0002, etc.
5. Verify assignments:
   ```sql
   -- View all assigned member IDs
   SELECT member_id, full_name, email, role, membership_status
   FROM user_profiles
   WHERE member_id IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY member_id;
   
   -- Check counter status
   SELECT * FROM member_id_counter;
   
   -- View assignment audit log
   SELECT * FROM member_id_assignment_log
   ORDER BY assigned_at DESC;
   ```

### Phase 2: Test Automatic Assignment

#### Test New User Registration
1. Create a test user account through normal registration
2. Check if member ID is automatically assigned:
   ```sql
   SELECT member_id, full_name, email, created_at
   FROM user_profiles
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. Expected: New user should have member ID in BI#### format
4. Counter should increment automatically

### Phase 3: Deploy Service Layer

#### Step 1: Push Code Changes
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement member ID system with auto-generation

- Add member ID counter and auto-generation (BI#### format)
- Backfill existing users with member IDs (Admin gets ADMIN###)
- Create memberIdService for ID management
- Add upgrade history tracking
- Auto-assign member IDs on user registration
- Member IDs are read-only (cannot be edited by admins)
"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
2. Check deployment logs for errors
3. Test the application loads correctly

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Database Tests
- [x] Member ID counter table exists
- [x] Auto-generation function works
- [x] Trigger fires on user insertion
- [x] Existing users have member IDs
- [x] Admin users have ADMIN### format
- [x] Regular users have BI#### format
- [x] Counter increments correctly
- [x] Audit log created

### Service Tests
- [ ] memberIdService.getNextMemberIdPreview() returns correct ID
- [ ] memberIdService.isValidFormat() validates correctly
- [ ] memberIdService.getMemberByMemberId() finds users
- [ ] memberIdService.searchByMemberId() works for autocomplete
- [ ] Member ID statistics display correctly

### Integration Tests (After wizard implementation)
- [ ] New user registration auto-assigns member ID
- [ ] Member approval wizard displays member ID
- [ ] Manual member addition assigns member ID
- [ ] Upgrade wizard finds members by ID
- [ ] Login with member ID works (future feature)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Member ID Rules
1. **Format**: 
   - Regular users: `BI####` (e.g., BI0001, BI0002, BI0150)
   - Admin users: `ADMIN###` (e.g., ADMIN001, ADMIN002)

2. **Assignment**:
   - Automatically assigned on user creation (via database trigger)
   - Cannot be edited after assignment (read-only)
   - Sequential based on creation order

3. **Usage**:
   - Required for future login (alongside email)
   - Displayed in all member communications
   - Used for member search and identification

### Security Considerations
1. Member IDs are unique and cannot be changed
2. Only admins can view all member IDs
3. Users can only see their own member ID
4. Member ID format is validated at database level
5. Trigger ensures no user is created without member ID

### Backwards Compatibility
1. Old member IDs (BKO-XXXXXX format) have been migrated
2. Audit log preserves old member IDs for reference
3. No breaking changes to existing functionality
4. Member ID is optional in queries (NULL-safe)

## üÜò ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If issues occur after deployment:

### Database Rollback
```sql

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_auto_assign_member_id ON public.user_profiles;

-- Remove constraints
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS user_profiles_member_id_format_check;

-- Restore old member IDs from audit log
UPDATE public.user_profiles up
SET member_id = mal.old_member_id
FROM member_id_assignment_log mal
WHERE up.id = mal.user_id
AND mal.old_member_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### Code Rollback
```powershell
# Revert to previous deployment in Vercel dashboard
# Or roll back commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

## üìû SUPPORT

For issues or questions during deployment:
1. Check Supabase logs for database errors
2. Check Vercel logs for application errors
3. Review audit logs in `member_id_assignment_log` table
4. Verify counter status in `member_id_counter` table
5. Test with a fresh user registration
