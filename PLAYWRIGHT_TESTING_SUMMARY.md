- Execute one action at a time

### Option 5: View Report
```bash
npm run test:report
```
**Best for:** Reviewing test results after execution

**Features:**
- HTML report with screenshots
- Video recordings of failures
- Detailed traces
- Timeline view

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before running tests, ensure:

- [ ] ✅ Playwright installed (`npx playwright install --with-deps`) ← DONE!
- [ ] `.env.test.local` created with YOUR admin credentials
- [ ] `EMERGENCY_SERVICE_ROLE_FIX.sql` applied to database (if not done)
- [ ] Website accessible at https://www.basicai.fit
- [ ] You know your admin login credentials

## 🔑 Setting Up Credentials

1. **Open** `.env.test.local` in your editor
2. **Replace** the placeholder credentials:
   ```
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-actual-email@basicai.fit
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-actual-password
   ```
3. **Save** the file
4. **Run** tests!

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit `.env.test.local` to git! (Already in .gitignore)

### Captured Artifacts

After each test run:
- **Screenshots** (on failure)
- **Videos** (on failure)
- **Traces** (on retry)
- **HTML Report** (always)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot find .env.test.local"
**Solution:** Create the file and add your credentials

### Problem: "Admin login failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Verify credentials in `.env.test.local`
2. Try logging in manually at https://www.basicai.fit
3. Check if admin account exists in database

### Problem: "User creation failed"
**Solution:**
1. Apply `EMERGENCY_SERVICE_ROLE_FIX.sql` in Supabase
2. Check Supabase logs for trigger errors
3. Verify RLS policies are correct

### Problem: "Timeout waiting for element"
**Solution:**
1. Check if website is accessible
2. Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`
3. Run with `npm run test:debug` to inspect

### Problem: "Test fails at password change"
**Solution:**
1. Verify password requirements (length, special chars)
2. Check if password change page exists at `/change-password`
3. Review form field names/selectors

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Update `.env.test.local`** with your real admin credentials
2. **Apply database fix** if not done: `EMERGENCY_SERVICE_ROLE_FIX.sql`
3. **Run tests** with `npm run test:ui` to see it in action
4. **Review results** and celebrate if tests pass! 🎉

### After Tests Pass:
1. Run tests on different browsers: `npm test -- --project=firefox`
2. Run tests on mobile: `npm test -- --project="Mobile Chrome"`
3. Set up CI/CD to run tests automatically
4. Add more test scenarios (content access, subscriptions, etc.)

## 🎊 Success Criteria

Tests confirm:
- ✅ Admin can create users without errors
- ✅ Temporary passwords are generated
- ✅ New users MUST change password on first login

2. **Check credentials** - Most failures are due to wrong credentials
3. **Read error messages** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Use debug mode** - Step through tests to find issues
5. **Check screenshots** - They show exactly what the test saw
6. **Watch videos** - See what happened before the failure
7. **Review traces** - Complete timeline of test execution
