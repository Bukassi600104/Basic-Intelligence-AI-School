   npm test              # Run all tests
   npm run test:ui       # Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
   npm run test:headed   # Run tests with visible browser
   npm run test:debug    # Debug tests step-by-step
   npm run test:report   # View HTML test report
   ```

4. **Test Documentation** (`tests/README.md`)
   - Complete guide for running tests
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Best practices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Set Your Admin Credentials
Create `.env.test.local` file in project root:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@basicai.fit
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-actual-password
BASE_URL=https://www.basicai.fit
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace with your ACTUAL admin credentials!

### Step 2: Run Tests

#### Option A: Run in UI Mode (Recommended First Time)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```
This opens an interactive browser where you can:
- ✅ See tests running in real-time
- ✅ Pause and inspect at any point
- ✅ Re-run individual tests
- ✅ Debug failures easily

#### Option B: Run in Headed Mode (See Browser)
```bash
npm run test:headed
```
Runs tests with visible browser so you can watch what's happening.

#### Option C: Run Normally (Headless)
```bash
npm test
```
Runs tests without visible browser (faster).

### Step 3: View Results
After tests run, view the HTML report:
```bash
npm run test:report
```

## 📋 What Will Be Tested

The test suite will verify:

### ✅ User Creation Flow
1. Admin logs in successfully
2. Admin navigates to users page
3. Admin creates new user with temporary password
4. User creation succeeds without errors
5. Temporary password is displayed

### ✅ Password Change Flow
1. New user logs in with temporary password
2. User is redirected to `/change-password` (forced)
3. User changes password successfully
4. User logs out
5. User logs in with new password
6. User is redirected to `/dashboard` (NOT `/change-password`)
7. User has access to dashboard

### ✅ Error Handling
1. Duplicate email shows appropriate error
2. Validation works correctly

## 🔍 Test Output Example

```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker

  ✓ [chromium] › user-creation.spec.js:35:3 › Complete user creation and password change flow (45s)
    ✓ Admin logs in (3s)
    ✓ Navigate to users management (2s)
    ✓ Create new user (8s)
    ✓ Admin logs out (2s)
    ✓ New user logs in with temporary password (3s)
    ✓ Change password (4s)
    ✓ User logs out after password change (2s)
    ✓ User logs in with new password (3s)
    ✓ Verify user can access dashboard (2s)

  ✓ [chromium] › user-creation.spec.js:142:3 › Verify database state after user creation (12s)
  ✓ [chromium] › user-creation.spec.js:168:3 › Should show error for duplicate email (15s)

  3 passed (72s)
```

## 🎯 Before Running Tests

**CRITICAL:** Ensure the following are complete:

1. ✅ `EMERGENCY_SERVICE_ROLE_FIX.sql` has been applied to database
2. ✅ Admin account exists and you know the credentials
3. ✅ Website is accessible at https://www.basicai.fit
4. ✅ `.env.test.local` file created with real credentials

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Test Fails at Login
- Verify admin credentials in `.env.test.local`
- Try logging in manually at https://www.basicai.fit
- Check if admin account exists in database

### Test Fails at "Create User"
- This means the database fix didn't work
- Run `EMERGENCY_SERVICE_ROLE_FIX.sql` in Supabase
- Check Supabase logs for trigger errors

### Timeout Errors
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`
- Check internet connection
- Verify website is accessible

### Can't Find Elements
- Run with `npm run test:debug` to inspect
- Check if UI has changed
- Update selectors in test file

## 📊 Test Reports

After running tests, you'll find:

- **HTML Report**: `playwright-report/index.html`
- **Screenshots**: `test-results/` (on failure)
- **Videos**: `test-results/` (on failure)
- **Traces**: `test-results/` (on retry)

View reports with:
```bash
npm run test:report
```

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Create `.env.test.local`** with your admin credentials
2. **Apply database fix** (`EMERGENCY_SERVICE_ROLE_FIX.sql`) if not done
3. **Run tests** with `npm run test:ui` to see it in action
4. **Review results** and verify everything passes
5. **Fix any failures** and re-run tests

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use UI Mode First**: `npm run test:ui` is great for learning
- **Debug Mode**: `npm run test:debug` lets you step through tests
- **Screenshots**: Failures automatically capture screenshots
- **Videos**: Watch what happened when test failed
- **Traces**: Complete timeline of test execution
