## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: OTP email not received
**Solutions:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify Resend API key is configured
3. Check Resend dashboard for delivery errors
4. Verify email address is not disposable
5. Check notification_logs table for error messages

### Issue: "Invalid or expired OTP code"
**Solutions:**
1. Check if OTP expired (15-minute limit)
2. Request new OTP (click "Resend")
3. Ensure correct 6-digit code entered
4. Check if maximum attempts (5) exceeded

### Issue: Activation email not sent
**Solutions:**
1. Check adminService.js logs in browser console
2. Verify template name is "Account Activated"
3. Check notification_templates table for active template
4. Verify Resend API key is valid
5. Check notification_logs for failed status

### Issue: Disposable email blocked but shouldn't be
**Solutions:**
1. Update disposable email list in `emailVerificationService.js`
2. Remove domain from `disposableDomains` array
3. Or disable validation temporarily for testing

---

## üí° TIPS FOR PRODUCTION

### Email Deliverability:
1. **Update from address** to `notifications@basicintelligence.ng` after DNS verification
2. **Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC** records to domain for better delivery rates
3. **Monitor bounce rates** in Resend dashboard
4. **Warm up new domain** by sending gradually increasing volumes
5. **Add unsubscribe link** to marketing emails (required by law)

### Performance Optimization:
1. **Cleanup expired tokens** regularly (run monthly):
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM email_verification_tokens 
   WHERE expires_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
   ```

2. **Index monitoring** - Check query performance:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
   SELECT * FROM email_verification_tokens 
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com' AND otp_code = '123456';
   ```

3. **Batch email sends** - Don't send 1000 emails at once, batch in groups of 100

### Security Best Practices:
1. **Rotate Resend API key** every 3-6 months
2. **Monitor for suspicious patterns** (many failed OTPs from same IP)
3. **Add CAPTCHA** if you notice bot registrations
4. **Review notification logs** weekly for anomalies
5. **Keep backup** of notification_templates table
