# Admin User Email Notification Setup

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure admin-created users receive the same welcome emails as self-registered users

---

## üéØ What Changed

Admin-created users now receive **two email notifications**:

1. **"Registration Thank You"** - Same welcome email that self-registered users get
2. **"Admin Created Account"** - Special email with login credentials and temporary password

---

## üìã Setup Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run the migration to add the new email template:

```sql
-- Copy and paste this into Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/migrations/add_admin_created_account_template.sql

INSERT INTO notification_templates (name, subject, content, category, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
  'Admin Created Account',
  'Your Basic Intelligence Account Has Been Created',
  '<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;">
    <h2 style="color: #4F46E5;">Welcome to Basic Intelligence!</h2>

)
ON CONFLICT (name) DO UPDATE
SET 
  subject = EXCLUDED.subject,
  content = EXCLUDED.content,
  updated_at = NOW();
```

### Step 2: Verify Template Creation

```sql
-- Check that the template was created
SELECT name, subject, category, is_active 
FROM notification_templates 
WHERE name = 'Admin Created Account';

-- Should return:
-- name: 'Admin Created Account'
-- subject: 'Your Basic Intelligence Account Has Been Created'
-- category: 'authentication'
-- is_active: true
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Verify changes
git log --oneline -3
# Should see: "Add email notifications for admin-created users"

# Deploy to Vercel (automatic if connected)
# Or manually: vercel --prod
```

## üß™ Testing the Email Flow

### Test 1: Create User via Admin Dashboard

1. Go to `/admin-dashboard` ‚Üí "Add User"
2. Fill in user details:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Role: Student
   - Membership Tier: Starter
3. Complete wizard and create user
4. Check browser console for logs:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Welcome email sent (Registration Thank You template)
   ‚úÖ Admin-created account credentials email sent
   ```

### Test 2: Check User's Email Inbox

User should receive **TWO emails**:

**Email 1: "Welcome to Basic Intelligence!"**
- Subject: Welcome to Basic Intelligence!
- Template: Registration Thank You
- Content: Welcome message, dashboard link, community intro

**Email 2: "Your Basic Intelligence Account Has Been Created"**
- Subject: Your Basic Intelligence Account Has Been Created
- Template: Admin Created Account
- Content: Login credentials, temporary password, security warning

### Test 3: User Login Flow

1. New user receives emails
2. User clicks "Login to Your Account" in email
3. User signs in with email + temporary password
4. **Redirected to `/force-password-change`**
5. User sets new password
6. User is redirected to dashboard

---

## üìß Email Template Variables

### Registration Thank You Template
```javascript
{
  full_name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  member_id: 'BKO-123456',
  membership_tier: 'starter',
  dashboard_url: 'https://basicintelligence.vercel.app/dashboard'
}
```

### Admin Created Account Template
```javascript
{
  full_name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  temporary_password: 'SecureTemp123!',
  login_url: 'https://basicintelligence.vercel.app/signin',
  dashboard_url: 'https://basicintelligence.vercel.app/dashboard'
}
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails Not Sending

**Check 1: Email Service Configuration**
```javascript
// In browser console (dev mode):
console.log('Email Service:', import.meta.env.VITE_RESEND_API_KEY ? 'Configured' : 'Missing');
```

**Check 2: Template Exists**
```sql
SELECT * FROM notification_templates 
WHERE name IN ('Registration Thank You', 'Admin Created Account');
```

**Check 3: Notification Logs**
```sql
SELECT recipient_email, template_name, status, error_message, created_at
FROM notification_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Issue: "Template not found" Error

**Solution:** Run the migration again
```sql
-- Delete and recreate
DELETE FROM notification_templates WHERE name = 'Admin Created Account';

-- Then run INSERT from Step 1 again
```

### Issue: Email Sent But User Didn't Receive

**Check 1: Email in Development Mode**
In development, check browser console for alert popup with OTP/credentials.

**Check 2: Email Logs**
```sql
SELECT * FROM notification_logs 
WHERE recipient_email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Check 3: Resend Dashboard**
Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Emails ‚Üí Check delivery status

### Issue: Email Failed (Non-Critical)

**Expected Behavior:**
- User creation should still succeed
- Console shows: `‚ö†Ô∏è Welcome email failed (non-critical)`
- User is created but didn't receive email
- Admin can manually share credentials

---

## üé≠ Development Mode vs Production

### Development Mode (localhost)
- Emails may not send (mock service)
- OTP/credentials shown in browser alert
- Console logs show email attempts
- Non-critical failures expected

### Production Mode (Vercel)
- Emails sent via Resend API
- Edge Function handles delivery
- Full email tracking in notification_logs
- Critical for user onboarding

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

When everything is working correctly:

1. ‚úÖ Admin creates user in dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Console shows: "‚úÖ Welcome email sent (Registration Thank You template)"
3. ‚úÖ Console shows: "‚úÖ Admin-created account credentials email sent"
4. ‚úÖ User receives 2 emails within 1 minute
5. ‚úÖ User can login with temporary password
6. ‚úÖ User is forced to change password on first login
7. ‚úÖ notification_logs table shows 2 successful email entries

---
