  if (contentId && prompts.length > 0) {
    const targetElement = document.getElementById(`prompt-${contentId}`);
    if (targetElement) {
      targetElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
      targetElement.classList.add('ring-2', 'ring-primary', 'ring-offset-2');
      setTimeout(() => {
        targetElement.classList.remove('ring-2', 'ring-primary', 'ring-offset-2');
      }, 3000);
    }
  }
}, [contentId, prompts]);

// Featured badge
{prompt.isFeatured && isFeatured && (

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User Clicks Featured Content on Homepage

1. **Homepage**: User sees featured content (video, PDF, or prompt)
2. **Click**: User clicks on featured content card
3. **Redirect**: `FeaturedContent.jsx` redirects to appropriate dashboard page:
   - Video → `/student-dashboard/videos?contentId=123&featured=true`
   - PDF → `/student-dashboard/pdfs?contentId=456&featured=true`
   - Prompt → `/student-dashboard/prompts?contentId=789&featured=true`
4. **Page Load**: Student dashboard page loads with all content
5. **Auto-Scroll**: Page automatically scrolls to the specific content item
6. **Highlight**: 2-second ring animation highlights the targeted content
7. **Featured Badge**: "Featured" badge is displayed on the content card
8. **Analytics**: Click is logged to `featured_content_clicks` table

### Scenario 2: User Shares Direct Link

1. **Share**: User copies URL like `/student-dashboard/videos?contentId=123&featured=true`
2. **Recipient**: Another user opens the shared link
3. **Same Experience**: Recipient gets same auto-scroll + highlight experience
4. **Context**: Featured badge shows this was a featured item

## Technical Implementation Details

### Query Parameters Used

| Parameter | Values | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `contentId` | UUID string | Identifies specific content item to highlight |
| `featured` | `'true'` or absent | Indicates content came from featured section |

### Scroll Behavior

- **Method**: `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })`
- **Timing**: 500ms delay after content loads (ensures DOM is ready)
- **Highlight**: 3-second ring animation using Tailwind classes
- **Classes Applied**: `ring-2`, `ring-primary`, `ring-offset-2`

### Featured Badge Styling

**Prompts & PDFs:**
```jsx
className="px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded-full text-xs font-medium bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-100 to-amber-100 text-amber-800 border border-amber-200 flex items-center gap-1"
```

**Videos (Overlay):**
```jsx
className="absolute top-2 left-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-amber-400 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium flex items-center gap-1 shadow-lg"
```

### Data Transformation

All three pages now include `isFeatured` field in data transformation:

```javascript
const transformedData = (data || []).map(item => ({
  // ... existing fields
  isFeatured: item.is_featured || false,
}));
```

---

## Integration Points

### Works With

1. **Homepage Featured Content** (`src/components/homepage/FeaturedContent.jsx`)
   - Redirects to appropriate dashboard page with query params
   - Passes `contentId` and `featured=true` in URL

2. **Content Service** (`src/services/contentService.js`)
   - `getAccessibleContent()` returns `is_featured` field
   - Field is already available in database schema

3. **Database Schema** (`content_library` table)
   - `is_featured` boolean column
   - `featured_order` integer for sorting
   - `featured_description` text for homepage display

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

- [ ] Test prompts page deep link: `/student-dashboard/prompts?contentId=<uuid>&featured=true`
- [ ] Test videos page deep link: `/student-dashboard/videos?contentId=<uuid>&featured=true`
- [ ] Test PDFs page deep link: `/student-dashboard/pdfs?contentId=<uuid>&featured=true`
- [ ] Verify auto-scroll works on all three pages
- [ ] Verify ring highlight animation appears and disappears after 3 seconds
- [ ] Verify Featured badge only shows when `featured=true` query param is present
- [ ] Verify Featured badge only shows on content where `is_featured=true` in database
- [ ] Test with non-existent `contentId` (should load page normally, no errors)
- [ ] Test without query parameters (should load page normally)
- [ ] Test scroll behavior on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify badge positioning looks good on all screen sizes

### User Scenarios to Test

1. **Featured Content Click Flow**
   - Mark content as featured in admin panel
   - View on homepage
   - Click featured content
   - Verify redirects to correct page with correct content highlighted

2. **Direct Link Sharing**
   - Copy URL with query parameters
   - Open in incognito/new browser
   - Verify auto-scroll and highlight work

3. **Mixed Content**
   - Have both featured and non-featured content on same page
   - Verify only featured items show badge when `featured=true` param is present

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Query Parameter Dependency**
   - Featured badge only shows when `featured=true` is in URL
   - If user navigates to page without query param, badge won't show even if content is featured
   - **Rationale**: Badge indicates "you came from featured section", not just "this is featured content"

2. **Scroll Timing**
   - 500ms delay may not be enough on very slow connections
   - Content may not be loaded when scroll is attempted
   - **Mitigation**: Effect depends on content array, won't execute until data is loaded

3. **Mobile Scroll Behavior**
   - Mobile browsers may have different scroll behavior
   - Ring highlight may be cut off by screen edges
   - **Testing Required**: Verify on actual mobile devices

## Next Steps (Phase 6)

With Phase 5 complete, we can now move to Phase 6: Authentication Flow Integration

### Phase 6 Tasks:

1. **Update AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
   - Add session storage for intended destination
   - Store `contentId` and `featured` params when redirecting to login
   - Restore params after successful login

2. **Update SignInPage** (`src/pages/auth/SignInPage.jsx`)
   - Check for stored intent in session storage
   - After login, redirect to intended page with query params
   - Clear session storage after redirect

3. **Update SignUpPage** (`src/pages/auth/SignUpPage.jsx`)
   - Show tier recommendation based on featured content access level
   - Pre-fill tier selection if coming from featured content
   - Store intent for post-registration redirect

4. **Update Homepage** (`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`)
   - Integrate `FeaturedContent` component
   - Position after hero section
   - Add loading states

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **User Guide**
   - Add section on "Featured Content Navigation"
   - Explain how to share direct links to specific content
   - Document Featured badge meaning

2. **Admin Guide**
   - Update content management documentation
   - Explain how featured content affects student experience
   - Document analytics tracking for featured clicks

3. **Developer Guide**
   - Document query parameter API
   - Explain deep linking implementation
   - Document scroll-to-content pattern for future pages

## Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Impact**: Query parameter parsing is lightweight
- **Scroll Performance**: `scrollIntoView` with `behavior: 'smooth'` is GPU-accelerated
- **Memory**: No additional state management overhead
- **Network**: No additional API calls required

---

## Accessibility Notes

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Highlighted content is keyboard-focusable
- **Screen Readers**: Featured badge text is readable by screen readers
- **Color Contrast**: Badge colors meet WCAG AA standards
- **Focus Management**: Ring animation is visible to keyboard users
