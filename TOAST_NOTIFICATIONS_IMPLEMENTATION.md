# 🔔 Toast Notifications Implementation - Complete

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue
Admin had no visual feedback when sending notifications:
- No success/error toast notifications
- Admin didn't know if emails were sent
- Silent failures with no indication

### Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive toast notifications to both admin notification pages using Sonner (shadcn toast library).

| All sent successfully | Success | "All notifications sent successfully! 🎉" |
