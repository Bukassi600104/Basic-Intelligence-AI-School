# Vercel Deployment Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. VITE_BASE_PATH Configuration
- Added `VITE_BASE_PATH=/` to `.env.example`
- Updated `vite.config.mjs` with base path support
- Updated React Router with basename configuration

- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Content-Security-Policy

### 4. Git Operations Completed

- âœ… Repository: `Basic-Intelligence-AI-School`

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Vercel Deployment

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Vercel
Go to your Vercel project dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables and add:

**Required:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public anon key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (mark as sensitive)
- `VITE_APP_NAME` - "Basic Intelligence Community School"
- `VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL` - Your support email
- `VITE_BASE_PATH` - "/" (default for root deployment)

**Optional:**
- `EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY` - For email services
- Payment provider keys (Paystack, Stripe)
- Security variables (JWT_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY)

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
Since you've already connected your GitHub repository to Vercel, the deployment should automatically trigger. If not:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Check that the application loads correctly
- Test navigation and routing
- Verify Supabase connectivity
- Test authentication flows

## ðŸ“‹ Current Configuration

### vercel.json (Fixed)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.html", "use": "@vercel/static" }],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Strict-Transport-Security", "value": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" },
        { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
        { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
        { "key": "Referrer-Policy", "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
        { "key": "Content-Security-Policy", "value": "default-src 'self' https:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https:; connect-src 'self' https://your_supabase_project_url_here https://*.supabase.co; img-src 'self' data: https:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:;" }
      ]
    }
