# Dependency Migration Plan

## Security Vulnerabilities Analysis

### Current Vulnerabilities (3 total)

#### High Severity (1)
- **vite** (v5.0.0) - Multiple security vulnerabilities including:
  - `server.fs.deny` bypass on case-insensitive filesystems (CVE-2024-XXXXX)
  - XSS vulnerability in `server.transformIndexHtml` via URL payload
  - Multiple `server.fs.deny` bypass vulnerabilities

#### Moderate Severity (2)
- **esbuild** (via vite) - Development server request interception vulnerability
- **postcss** (v8.4.8) - Line return parsing error

### Recommended Upgrade Paths

#### Immediate Security Fixes (npm audit fix --force)

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

This will upgrade:
- **vite**: 5.0.0 → 5.4.20 (fixes all security vulnerabilities)
- **postcss**: 8.4.8 → 8.5.6 (fixes parsing vulnerability)

#### Major Version Upgrades (Requires Testing)

**High Priority:**
1. **React Ecosystem** (Major breaking changes)
   - react: 18.3.1 → 19.2.0
   - react-dom: 18.3.1 → 19.2.0
   - react-router-dom: 6.0.2 → 7.9.4

2. **Build Tools** (Breaking changes likely)
   - vite: 5.0.0 → 7.1.10
   - @vitejs/plugin-react: 4.3.4 → 5.0.4

3. **Styling** (Breaking changes likely)
   - tailwindcss: 3.4.6 → 4.1.14
   - @tailwindcss/line-clamp: 0.1.0 → 0.4.4

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Testing** (Breaking changes likely)
   - @testing-library/jest-dom: 5.17.0 → 6.9.1
   - @testing-library/react: 11.2.7 → 16.3.0
   - @testing-library/user-event: 12.8.3 → 14.6.1

5. **UI Components** (Breaking changes possible)
   - framer-motion: 10.18.0 → 12.23.24
   - lucide-react: 0.484.0 → 0.546.0
   - recharts: 2.15.4 → 3.3.0

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Security Patches (Immediate)
- Run `npm audit fix --force` to address critical vulnerabilities
- Test build and basic functionality
- Deploy security fixes

#### Phase 2: React 19 Migration (High Priority)
1. Update React and React DOM to v19
2. Update React Router to v7
3. Test all routing and component functionality
4. Address breaking changes in React 19

#### Phase 3: Build Tools Upgrade (Medium Priority)
1. Update Vite and related plugins
2. Test build process and development server
3. Update configuration files as needed

#### Phase 4: Styling Updates (Medium Priority)
1. Update Tailwind CSS to v4
2. Update related styling dependencies
3. Test responsive design and styling

### Testing Requirements

After each upgrade phase:
- [ ] Build process works without errors
- [ ] Development server starts correctly
- [ ] All pages load without console errors
- [ ] Authentication flows work
- [ ] Admin dashboard functionality
- [ ] Student dashboard functionality
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Form submissions work

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- React 18 → 19 migration (breaking changes in concurrent features)
- Vite major version upgrades (configuration changes)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (syntax changes)

**Medium Risk:**
- React Router v6 → v7 (API changes)
- Testing library updates (testing patterns may change)

**Low Risk:**
- Utility libraries (dotenv, autoprefixer)
- UI component libraries (minor version updates)

### Rollback Plan

1. Keep current `package-lock.json` as backup
2. Create git branch for each upgrade phase
3. Test thoroughly before merging to main
4. Have rollback procedure ready for production deployment

### Notes

- Current project uses Vite 5.0.0 which has multiple security vulnerabilities
- React 19 introduces significant changes to concurrent rendering
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires migration from PostCSS 7 syntax
- Consider creating a staging environment for testing major upgrades
