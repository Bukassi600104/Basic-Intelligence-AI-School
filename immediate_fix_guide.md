# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR EMAIL CONFLICT ERROR

## Current Status
✅ **Service Key**: NOT CONFIGURED (this is the root cause)
✅ **Solution Tools**: READY TO USE
✅ **Manual Cleanup**: REQUIRED

## Step 1: Get Your Service Key (Long-term Solution)

### Quick Steps:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: **eremjpneqofidtktsfya**
3. Click **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy **Service Role Key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)
5. Update `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-key-here
   ```

## Step 2: Immediate Manual Cleanup (Do This NOW)

### Run This SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- STEP 1: Identify orphaned users
SELECT 
    au.id as auth_user_id,
    au.email,
    au.created_at as auth_created
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles up ON au.id = up.id
WHERE up.id IS NULL;
```

### If you see orphaned users, delete them:

```sql
-- STEP 2: Delete specific orphaned users (replace email)
DELETE FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'conflicting-email@example.com'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles up WHERE up.id = auth.users.id
);
```

## Step 3: Test User Creation

After cleanup, try creating users with previously conflicting emails - they should now work.

## Step 4: Configure Service Key (Prevent Future Issues)

Once you get the service key, update `.env` and restart your development server.

## Common Orphaned User Emails

Check for these common patterns:
- Test users you've created and deleted
- Demo accounts
- Any email you've tried to reuse

## Quick Verification

After cleanup, test with:
1. Create a test user
2. Delete the test user
3. Create another user with the same email

If step 3 works, the issue is resolved!

## Emergency Contact

If you're still having issues:
1. Run the diagnostic query above
2. Share the results (which emails are orphaned)
3. I'll provide targeted deletion commands

**The system is ready - we just need to clean up the orphaned users!**
